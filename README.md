# Classroom-Trivia

Weekly classroom trivia digitized.

## About The Project

The project has two parts to it:

1. An app made in firebase, flutter, & dart
2. A physical buzzer beater system made with an Arduino

## Flutter App

The app serves the purpose of keeping track of trivia stats from teams across the school, where they can update their name, color, points, and tagline.

Future goals:
1. Arduino uploads data, about who press the buzzer first, to firebase
2. App can fetch winning stats and show probability of who's most likely to press buzzer next

## Buzzer Beater System

This idea was born when there was a conflict between students over who "buzzed" first, and it came to me that technology could easily solve this. Using a couple of auxiliary cables, an arduino, cheap buttons, and some wood, I constructed a buzzer beater system. This was a lot more fair to the students, and quite easy to setup.

The project is designed to be a budget friendly option for teachers who want to implement a trivia system in their classrooms.

Unfortunately due to schools closing down, I was not able to get any picture of the product. However, a rough sketch of what the project setup could look like is shown below.
