# Buzzer-Beater-System

A simple classroom buzzer beater system.

## About The Project

The project is designed to be a budget friendly option for teachers who want to implement a trivia system in their classrooms. The current model can only accomodate up to 4 teams, however it is easily expandable, as long as your Arduino board has sufficient ports.

This idea was born when there was a conflict between students over who "buzzed" first, and it came to me that technologoy could easily solve this. Using a couple of auxiliary cables, an arduino, cheap buttons, and some wood, I constructed a buzzer beater system. This was a lot more fair to the students, and quite easy to setup.

## Sample Design

Unfortunately due to schools closing down, I was not able to get any picture of the product. However, a rough sketch of what the project setup could look like is shown below.
